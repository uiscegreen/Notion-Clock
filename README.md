# Notion-Clock
A simple digital clock widget made for Notion. 
I didn't want to have to create an account for a million different websites just to download a clock widget, so figured I'll stop being lazy and create my own. 

Also if you found this and want to try it out, go ahead! 
Use it or modify it, but Iâ€™m not responsible if it somehow breaks. 

^^^ This was honestly the biggest pain to make, it broke about a million times when I added both files to the repo.
I had to do so many baby edits, like 40 times trying to figure it out
